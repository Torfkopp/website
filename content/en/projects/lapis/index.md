title: "Lapis Discord Bot"
---

Lapis is a Discord bot written in python.
The initial plan for the bot was only handling APIs, e.g. for football scores, hence the name "lAPIs".
However, it grew with time and now has many more features - several of them not having to do anything with APIs.

The bot was my first real project in python. 
The older code the code is, the rougher it is;
but this is what learning is, I guess.
