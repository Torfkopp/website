title: "Typst"

[Typst](https://typst.app/docs/) is a modern typesetting system that is designed to be simple and powerful.
It is a great alternative to LaTeX, especially for those who prefer a more intuitive syntax and modern features.
I have been using Typst for a while now and I really enjoy it.

Since there are only a LaTeX and a PPTX version of the University of Oldenburg's slide template, I created a Typst version:
{{< github repo="torfkopp/not-uol-template" showThumbnail=true >}}

I also had several ideas for improving the [Diatypst](https://typst.app/universe/package/diatypst/) template of Typst, which I put into following repository:
{{< github repo="torfkopp/buffed-diatypst" showThumbnail=true >}}
